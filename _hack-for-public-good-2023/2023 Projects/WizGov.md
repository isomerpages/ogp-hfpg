### Problem
Public officers find it difficult to add new features to their existing websites independently, and getting their website vendors to make changes can take days/weeks. This makes it difficult for government websites who need to iterate frequently to serve public needs quickly.

### Solution
Our tool allows public officers to create widgets of commonly used OGP tools like AskGov to integrate into their website, improving the accessibility of information & interactivity of their agency's websites.
