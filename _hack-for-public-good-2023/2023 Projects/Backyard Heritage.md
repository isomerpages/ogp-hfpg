### Problem
There are 23 self-guided heritage trails in Singapore. Despite a rich history, very few people know about it or connect to it in a meaningful way.

### Solution
A dynamic, personalised telegram bot that enhances citizens’ experience in the discovery of Singapore’s heritage and history.  
The bot prompts users with:  

*   Directions and suggested next stops
*   Human interest stories
*   Bite-sized facts with multimedia content
*   Nearby food recommendations
