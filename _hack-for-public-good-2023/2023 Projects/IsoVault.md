### Problem
Isomer simplifies building static sites for the government, but there are over 2000 services in the government requiring database interactions (transactions), costing thousands of dollars to build and maintain. If we simplify a significant proportion of these transactions, we could save the government hundreds of millions of dollars each year.

### Solution
To build an interface that pulls data from Vault, where the user is able to set criteria for what info can be displayed or can be searchable. This transactional service could subsequently be embedded as an iframe in an Isomer site.
