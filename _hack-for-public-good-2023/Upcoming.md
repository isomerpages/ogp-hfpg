[Open Government Products](https://open.gov.sg)’ (OGP) Hack for Public Good (HFPG) 2023 will take place from 3 January - 9 February. Our team will work with other government agencies to seed public good problems, build prototypes, and launch products. 

(Read [here](https://hack.gov.sg/about-hfpg/hfpg/) to find out more about HFPG)

Phase 1: Seed (3 - 6 January)
-----------------------------

During the first week of HFPG, problem statements submitted by the [general public](https://go.gov.sg/ogp-citizens) and public sector agencies are explored in depth through a series of pitch-activities. Our team will use the week to identify the most impactful problem spaces that can be addressed through technology solutions. 

Phase 2: Build (6 January - 6 February) 
----------------------------------------

Once teams have formed around the most impactful problem statements, they spend a month building prototypes. Domain experts (i.e public officers who have identified and pitched problem statements faced by their agency and users) are embedded in the teams to enable a rapid-feedback cycle during prototyping and ensure product value, relevance and usability. Teams also participate in weekly design thinking workshops, product critique sessions, and team presentations to update on their progress.

Phase 3: Launch (6 - 9 February)
--------------------------------

In the final week of HFPG, teams prepare for Demo Day on 9 February 2023. Demo Day is an opportunity for teams to present their prototypes to senior government officials and the public. Demo Day will be an opportunity for teams to persuade decision makers to further resource prototypes with traction. This ensures that some of these prototypes can become full-fledged products that deliver public good impact.

Demo Day will be livestreamed to the public. Stay tuned for more details.
