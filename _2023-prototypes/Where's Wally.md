### Problem
Image repositories are usually massive file dumps, and retrieving a particular image from past archives is a near impossible task.

A platform for government agencies to:

(c) **Find** specific photos and videos depending on agencies' needs â€“ via easy-to-navigate ways such as gallery/thumbnail views
