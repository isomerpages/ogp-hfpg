### Problem
*   There is no **_common_** platform to explore, discover, and adopt tech tools with clear use cases for **public officers**.

### Solution
A monthly mailing list.This mailing list that backlinks to/ pulls data from an open, crowdsourced but **_curated_**\* repository of tech tools to encourage experimentation and early adoption among **public officers**, starting with a stocktake of H4PG projects from 2021 to present.**_\*curation_** at this point is manual. It is based on the following criteria:  

*   If MVP or product exists, should be free or at least have a free tier
*   There is some validation of actual use cases among civil servants
*   If the MVP or product does not exist, the product concept should have a clear problem, proposed solution and/or documentation of ‘failure’
