### Problem
Singapore generated 1.82 million tonnes of domestic waste in 2021, and is stuck in a 'buy-throw' rather than 'donate-reuse' cycle. This is partly due to high coordination overheads to donate/source good quality items.

### Solution
A fuss-free and secure digital platform where verified users can donate and source good quality items, for free, with priority given to those who need it the most (e.g. charities/SSOs or individuals vouched for by them).
