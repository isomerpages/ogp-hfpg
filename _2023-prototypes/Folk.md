### Problem
2 in 5 Singaporeans have experienced mental health struggles. We’ve spoken to married couples, singles, and divorcees. There’s one consensus - its hard to make friends as an adult. Loneliness isn’t all too uncommon a feeling. Studies prove that it impacts not only our mental, but also physical health.
