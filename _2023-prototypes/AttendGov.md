### Problem
Many secretariats in the public sector need to organise large meetings on a regular basis, and need to collect attendance details before the event. This is currently done manually.

### Solution
Provide a platform for secretariats to manage attendance collation pre-event, with the main features of 1) reconciling attendance responses and 2) automating the sending of reminder emails to invitees.
