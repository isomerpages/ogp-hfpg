### Problem
Procurement for anything >$6k is long and tedious, and despite safeguards and long processes, end up with less-than-ideal outcomes. This is because most buyers lack market knowledge, and prolonged procurement processes increase costs for all parties.

### Solution
For the initial phase: a guided procurement form, with template/document generator to reduce back & forth with the procurement team, and avoid mistakes by inexperienced buyers.  
  
Subsequently: a case management and approval system to expedite procurement, and include market benchmarks/best practices into the flow to create better outcomes at a later stage.
