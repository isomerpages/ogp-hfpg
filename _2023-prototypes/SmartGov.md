### Problem
Many government officers are tasked with answering citizens’ questions, which is cumbersome because they need to fetch information from multiple sources. Information isn’t always easily accessible, and may require knowledge of specific individuals to get it. Time is a constraint too, as officers have other duties in addition to answering questions from citizens, making it difficult to efficiently find necessary information.

### Solution
An AI-powered Government Question Answering System that can understand and respond to natural language questions from citizens about government services, policies, and procedures.
