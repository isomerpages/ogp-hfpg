### Problem
Patients are forced to be present to register and queue at GPs/PHIs; clinics are having trouble manually managing walk-ins & appointments every day.

### Solution
(For patients) Join queues from anywhere, and track their queue position real time until it's their turn.  
  
(For clinics) Fully-managed queue management, with optional TV display for waiting areas.
