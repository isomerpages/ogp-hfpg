#### What is Hack for Public Good?

Every year, for the entire month of January, our officers pause non-core projects to work on a public good problem that interests them. Throughout the month, our officers go through the iterative process of generating new ideas for products, conducting user research, and prototyping, with the end goal of showcasing working prototypes by the end of the month. Hack for Public Good also provides an opportunity for OGP officers to learn and develop new skills as they work to build new products.

Instead of traditional top-down product development, where leaders dictate product strategy and direction for tech teams to implement, OGPâ€™s Hack for Public Good strives to take a citizen-centric approach, empowering our tech teams to go into the community themselves to discover what public good problems there are in Singapore, and brainstorm and build ways to solve them.
