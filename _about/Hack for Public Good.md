<h4>What is Hack for Public Good?</h4>
<p>Every year, for the entire month of January, our officers pause non-core
projects to work on a public good problem that interests them. Throughout
the month, our officers go through the iterative process of generating
new ideas for products, conducting user research, and prototyping, with
the end goal of showcasing working prototypes by the end of the month.
Hack for Public Good also provides an opportunity for OGP officers to learn
and develop new skills as they work to build new products.</p>
<p>Instead of traditional top-down product development, where leaders dictate
product strategy and direction for tech teams to implement, OGPâ€™s Hack
for Public Good strives to take a citizen-centric approach, empowering
our tech teams to go into the community themselves to discover what public
good problems there are in Singapore, and brainstorm and build ways to
solve them.</p>
