#### What happens during Hack For Public Good?
##### Learning Journeys

Hack for Public Good starts with officers embarking on learning journeys within the community, attending sharings from public officers on the ground to better understand the nuances and challenges of their work. The invited speakers come from all areas of public service so that our officers are exposed to a wide set of experiences, constraints and opportunities. Having our officers understand what the ground is feeling and facing allows us to align the solutions we build to actual experiences, and deliver public good.

##### Ideation and Prototyping

Mixers and ideation workshops also allow our officers to exchange ideas and identify areas that they want to tackle. Once teams identify a problem they want to work on, they then spend the rest of the month building and prototyping solutions. Coming up with a meaningful solution to a problem is often a non-stop iterative process of research, building, testing, and refining. During this process, our engineers, designers and product managers work very closely together so that the feedback loop can be kept closed and tightly moving.

##### Finale

Hack for Public Good culminates at the end of the month with groups presenting their final working prototypes at the finale to other OGP officers and invited government leaders. After the finale presentations, many prototypes that have shown potential to create value for the public then get converted to fully-fledged OGP products.
