### Problem
Our current annual security audits carried out by GovTech CyberSec Group are expensive in terms of manpower and time (each PT takes 2 weeks for a team of 2-4). The number of reports triaged has also increased almost twofold from 2019 to 2021. But these reports don't provide very good continuity, and just capture vulnerabilities at a single point in time.

### Solution
Golden Path lets engineering teams behind government systems add their code bases to the platform for automated vulnerability scanning. 

The system does static scans and augmented audits (with auditors performing checks when completely necessary), to reduce time spent on each security audit, and offer continuous auditing where possible.
