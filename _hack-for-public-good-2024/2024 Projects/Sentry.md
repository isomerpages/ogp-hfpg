<h3>Sentry</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>We consistently receive an endless barrage of emails, messages and calls
trying to steal information or, worse still, money from us. These attempts
are getting more sophisticated by the day, and it can be difficult to know
whether the person on the other end is really who they claim they are.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>Often, these malicious actors can build up a comprehensive repository
of personal information just from data leaked about you online. How might
we help the public increase their ability to be more conscious about their
data breaches and the scam attempts they will be subject to?</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>Sentry seeks to help the public level the playing field by allowing them
to see which of their personal information has been leaked online and by
who.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With this information, Sentry will then provide greater information on
the kinds of scam attempts that they are most likely to be subject to and
what they can do to prevent themselves from falling victim to those scams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<blockquote>
<p>We conducted a survey of 72 individuals aged between 18 to 60 and recorded
that:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Scams are indeed prevalent and sophisticated. But, there is more room to help equip people with the ability to self-help.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Around 60% of respondents shared that they have been subjected to some
kind of sophisticated phishing attempt (i.e. scams with a fair bit of social
engineering).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet, over 72% have no good sense of what to do or where to turn to for
help.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>That there is demand for such a product.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>97% of respondents would like to know which of their personal information
has been leaked online.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100% of respondents said that they would like to know what kind of scams
they are most likely to be subject to.</p>

</ul>

<h4>Whatâ€™s next?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The team will be looking to expand our database of information, improve
our existing features and focus on refining our user interface and experience.
The next phase would focus on running pilots and getting more feedback
from users.&nbsp;
