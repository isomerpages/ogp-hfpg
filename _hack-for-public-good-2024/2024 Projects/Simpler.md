<h3>Simpler</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Current online materials are more oriented for adult readers, as they
contain complex jargon and lack contextual relevance for young minds. This
makes it challenging for school-going kids to comprehend online research
materials and effectively utilize these materials in their school work.
This hinders them from fully benefiting from online research for educational
purposes.</p>
<p>The mismatch between online resources and children's cognitive readiness
creates barriers to effective learning, hindering their academic progress
and understanding of the material. Children may become disengaged from
the learning process when faced with materials that are not tailored to
their developmental stage, leading to reduced motivation and interest in
learning.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>A Chrome extension that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) and the Lexile
Framework for Reading to transform content on websites to simpler content.
A student browsing information online can select content from the site,
and the simpler content, according to a selected Lexile level, will be
displayed on the side panel.</p>
