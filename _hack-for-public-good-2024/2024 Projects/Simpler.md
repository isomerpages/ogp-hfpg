<h3>Simpler</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Current online materials are more oriented for adult readers, as they
contain complex jargon and lack contextual relevance for young minds. This
makes it challenging for school-going kids to comprehend online information
and effectively utilise these materials in their school work, and also
hinders them from fully benefitting from online research for educational
purposes. Children may also become disengaged from the learning process
when faced with materials that are not tailored to their developmental
stage, leading to reduced motivation and interest in learning.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>A Chrome extension that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) and the Lexile
Framework for Reading to transform content on websites to simpler content.
A student browsing information online can select content from the site,
and the simpler content, according to a selected Lexile level, will be
displayed on the side panel.</p>
