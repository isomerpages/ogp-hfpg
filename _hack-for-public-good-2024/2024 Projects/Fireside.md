<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Work burnout is associated with a higher likelihood of physical and psychological
health problems^1^. More young adults are facing work burnout, with 57%
of Singaporeans reporting that burnout was the leading factor affecting
their mental health2.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Fireside is a web app that tackles the growing problem of work burnout
among young working adults.
<br>
<br>1. Assess your work stressors to find out your <strong>biggest occupational risk factors</strong>
</p>
<p>2. Chat with Flamey, our friendly chatbot, to <strong>share your work rants anonymously and securely</strong>
</p>
<p>3. Let Flamey convert work rants into <strong>constructive feedback</strong> for
managers, teammates or HR</p>
<p>4. Explore self-help resources to <strong>manage work burnout symptoms</strong>
</p>
<p>Flamey the chat bot is powered by ChatGPT 3.5, and has been engineered
to follow a conversation flow that models after the Cognitive Behavioural
Therapy framework. This framework aims to identify and challenge negative
thought patterns and behaviours to promote healthier cognitive and emotional
responses.</p>
<p>Work stressors are assessed using the UK HSE Management Standards quiz,
a psychometrically verified measure of work-related stress2, to inform
the user of their main risk factors for burnout. The user can then bring
these results to Flamey to address them, or find out more.</p>
