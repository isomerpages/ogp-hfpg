<h3>Crystal Ball</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>A problem in policymaking (as well as in life) is trying to predict the
future. Generalist policymakers relying on conventional forecasting methods
must aggregate across different sources to make a best guess of the future.
It is difficult for them to directly assess evidence and analysis of expert's
forecasts as experts are relied upon precisely for their expertise.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Prediction markets are a promising tool to incorporate different sources
of information into a single price in a credible and authoritative manner
by incentivising participants to correct any mispricing. In every known
head-to-head comparison with other forward-looking institutions, prediction
markets have been at least as accurate.</p>
<p>We have created a simple proof-of-concept of a prediction market that
allows users to create Yes/No questions that other users can bet on. In
parallel, we are also in talks with agencies to draft a list of policy-relevant
questions that will be shared on an existing prediction market, in order
to assess whether this could be a useful method of forecasting the future.</p>
