<h3>Crystal Ball</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>"It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future."</p>
<p>Policymaking frequently involves predicting the future, but the future
is inherently uncertain. Generalist policymakers relying on conventional
forecasting methods must aggregate across different sources to make a best
guess of the future. It is difficult for them to directly assess evidence
and analysis of expert's forecasts as experts are relied upon precisely
for their expertise.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Prediction markets can potentially solve the problem by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Giving policymakers a forward-looking view of a future state of the world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow policymakers to pre-emptively stage policy interventions to shift
future outcomes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The concept of prediction markets have been <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/PromisePredMkt.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">endorsed by Nobel-winning economists</a> and
works as a mechanism to incorporate different sources of information into
a single accurate and canonical view. For more information, read <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/prediction-market-faq" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>We have two work tracks.</p>
<p>The first track involves creating a simple demo that allows users to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Create an account using Singpass and receive 500 units of a virtual currency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create Yes/No questions that other users can bet on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place bets on questions (via market order or limit order), which would
shift the probability via an Automated Market Maker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close and resolve the markets, which will give virtual currency to users
who bet correctly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View a leaderboard showing users who have made the most from their bets</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Feedback from users:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>“I really like this project! I feel like it’s the most interesting one,
it’s such a unique concept!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Do you all gamble a lot?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concept of prediction markets and exact mechanics of how prices and probabilities
are generated are confusing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concern over whether this would normalise gambling in Singapore</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The second work track is to assess the whether policy-relevant questions
can be successfully answered using prediction markets by conducting a low-cost
proof-of-concept.</p>
<p>We are currently working with agencies to draft a list of such questions
that cover a range of different policy areas, different question types,
and different levels of uncertainty. When ready, these these questions
will be posted on an existing prediction market platform with a thriving
user-base and track record of accuracy.</p>
