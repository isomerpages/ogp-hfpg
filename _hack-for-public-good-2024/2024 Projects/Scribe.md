<h3>Scribe</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Medical Social Workers (MSWs) typically spend a long time documenting
and consolidating their case notes post-patient meetings.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Scribe<strong> </strong>is a tool that helps MSWs synthesise MSW-Patient
conversations into structured progress notes. It automatically transcribes
and summarises these conversations, providing MSWs with a solid foundation
to swiftly compose their notes. By accelerating the note-writing process,
Scribe enables MSWs to prioritise what truly mattersâ€”fostering meaningful
connections and enhancing patient care. Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16QDvSIQ6UdnYeybOe0AVQMBcvDnilKTs-NI-Y_WbkR0/edit#slide=id.g2666e7285fb_0_0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to
