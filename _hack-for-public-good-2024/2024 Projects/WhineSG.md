<h3>WhineSG</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>1) Discoverability: If public officers encounter issues and no one hears
it, does the problem exist?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Knowledge sharing: could sharing expertise across domains or sectors
lead to more effective solutioning?</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>WhineSG encourages public officers to surface problems so we can crowdsource
issues and solutions while empowering admins to act on authentic concerns.
