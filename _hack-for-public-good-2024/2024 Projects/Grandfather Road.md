<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Grandfather Road is an attempt to make learning about Singapore's heritage
and history fun and shareable. The result is a hyper-local quiz to explore
neighbourhoods via roads, sprinkled with local terms/slang and imagery.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The team started with the simple question of how much people know about
the area or neighbourhood they live in, and how we could help them learn
more about it.</p>
<p>We focused on roads, as they are most widely available and all around
us, instead of focusing on specific heritage buildings or areas where some
might be lacking. To validate our idea on the interest in roads, we did
two things:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We surveyed friends, family and colleagues on how much they knew of the
origins of their neighbourhood roads e.g. Why is Simei called Simei, or
Did you know there is a Kay Poh Road in Singapore? It was generally met
with curiosity but didn’t motivate people to dive deeper into it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We looked online to see if this information was widely available. It was
in bits and pieces across various blogs, websites, videos, and sites or
PDFs created by NLB or NHB. However, these were not easily findable or
purpose-made.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We found that users were generally interested in the names and history
of streets they live on or near, but needed more of a push to act on that
curiosity.</p>
<h4>Product Goals</h4>
<p>The goals for the product set by the team were to ensure the product was:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Visually attractive: </strong>To entice users to look at the product
and learn more about the roads</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fun: </strong>For users to enjoy the learning experience, and
for the designers to be able to stretch their design skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shareable: </strong>To entice users to share it forward, and get
others to learn in the process</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>The team tried several directions on how the product could work, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A quiz-like product to test users on the history of the roads near or
around them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A game inspired by Back Of Your Hand, in which users are given a street
name and have to pinpoint it on a map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A walkabout adventure through different districts, explaining the heritage
and history of roads found in them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We eventually decided to go with a quiz, since it achieved two of our
three goals (Fun and Shareable, as there was an element of competition).
We turned the geolocator idea into a question format in the quiz, and expanded
it to include pictures of historically significant landmarks to identify
the streets they’re on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team also considered building pages for each street, so users could
explore and find the histories of specific streets or roads if they wanted
to. These pages could then be used in geolocation settings, such as exploring
the streets near the users. Once these features are built, they could also
be expanded to landmarks, historically significant buildings, statues,
or entire areas.</p>

<p>We dropped the idea of the walkabout adventure, as there have been prior
similar attempts made by other media outlets, and since it was very specific,
it would take a lot of work to generalise it.</p>
<p>Other competitive elements were added in the process, such as the introduction
of regions for the users to select, building on the eternal (but unofficial)
East vs West and South vs North competition. This helped narrow the questions
to a more personal and familiar area for the user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each region features iconic visual elements that follow the user across
the site. e.g. Central has the Dragon Playground in Toa Payoh, and North-East
has the iconic rainbow HDB in Hougang.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pages displaying your quiz scores were also customised by region to
emphasise the game's competitive aspect, and add an element of fun. We
initially thought of using a 0 to 10 scoring system, but later decided
to make it more familiar by using A+, B, C, D, E, and F grades to mirror
how we’re scored on tests in a school setting.</p>

<p><em>Examples of the result screen</em>
</p>
<p>Our grading was initially set to:
<br>9 - 10: A
<br>8: B
<br>7: C
<br>6: D
<br>5: E
<br>&lt;5: F
<br>
</p>
<p>But when we tested prototypes on users, they felt the scoring was too
strict, and getting Ds and Es was demoralising. We later relaxed the scoring
slightly (while still maintaining the high standards an Asian parent would
expect):
<br>8 - 10: A
<br>7: B
<br>6: C
<br>5: D
<br>&lt;5: F</p>
<p>To keep players on their toes, we added a scoreboard showing how many
people from each region ‘passed’ the quiz:</p>

<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>The quiz can be found <a href="https://grandfatherroad.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a> On Demo Day alone, we had
151 people who played the quiz with 51 passes, 100 fails, and 5 people
scoring an A+. Asian Parents we are.</p>
<p>In the week after Demo Day we had a steady trickle of people playing and
sharing the quiz, with 534 people playing, 209 people passing, 325 people
failing, and 29 people (that we’re very proud of) scoring an A+.</p>
