<h3>Social Passport</h3>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Social Passport is a tool that enables clients to easily share their information
with care providers. By logging in via Singpass and selecting the relevant
information, clients can generate a unique link containing the necessary
details for care providers to effectively support them.</p>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Clients or patients often interact with multiple care providers across
health and community settings, such as social workers and medical social
workers. However, there is a lack of visibility and data sharing between
these providers today, which results in patients/clients having to repeat
themselves multiple times, or impacted quality of care when care plans
are made based on assumptions or are delayed due to information gaps.</p>
<p>Pain points include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Clients have to repeat themselves over and over again when meeting different
care providers
<br><strong>“Patients view us [health + social] as one unified system and sometimes they wonder why they need to repeat themselves”&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clients do not have visibility over their own information
<br><strong>“It’s not that they don’t want to tell us. Sometimes they ownself don’t know what subsidies they have.”</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Care providers spend time on information-sourcing, which might result
in delaying care for clients
<br><strong>“Clients may not give accurate information, so a lot of work is spent on hunting... it’s like detective work…”</strong> 
<br><strong>“Intervention can be late. We can’t refer to other services because they say we never give them the info.”</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Value Proposition</h4>
<p>Social passport aims to empower clients with full data ownership -</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clients can get the care required quicker with information transparency</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Clients typically meet up with various care providers in different agencies.
They can now easily share the same set of information directly.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Care providers can focus on supporting clients rather than information
hunting</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Care providers no longer need to spend hours to contact other sources
for information, and can instead come up with a comprehensive care plan.</p>
