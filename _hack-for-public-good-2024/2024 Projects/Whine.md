<h3>Whine</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>The typical public officer fears speaking up, is siloed in an agency,
and is content with the status quo. As a result, inefficient systems, duplicated
solutions, and suboptimal practices proliferate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modeled after community platforms like Kaggle and Stackoverflow, <em>Whine</em> encourages
public officers to surface problems so we can crowdsource issues and solutions
(tech and/ or otherwise) while also empowering admins to act on authentic
concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p><em>Whine</em> operates on the premise of <strong>problem validation</strong> ('whining'
+ upvoting to better identify issues that matter) and <strong>crowdsolving</strong> (admins
typically have no reason whatsoever to reinvent the wheel):</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><em>Data and knowledge sharing</em></strong>: <em>Whine</em> loads
past problem-solution pairs from OGP hackathons as well as agency-facing
sprints (e.g. HealthTech Sprint, Public Service Sprint) which serve as
points of reference for other hackathon organizers and participants in
public service. Beyond OGP-related content, we are also working with Centre
for Healthcare Innovation (CHI) as well as Institute of Public Administration
&amp; Management of Civil Service College (CSC) to import domain-specific
problems/ solutions into our database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Semantic search</em></strong><em>:</em> As the number of problem
statements on the platform increases, we want to minimize duplicate effort
in crafting the same problems/solutions. Semantic search applies at the
point of problem creation so officers can arrive at solutions faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Events</em></strong><em>:</em><strong><em> </em></strong>Beyond
just contributing problems online, <em>Whine</em> encourages contributors
to show up to offline events/ hackathons (e.g. Hack for Public Good) so
officers take greater ownership and show-up to try to solve their problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Leaderboard: </em></strong><em>Whine</em> actively tracks and
acknowledges community contributors with a leaderboard - we are considering
additional perks such as additional in-app and offline privileges to affirm
constructive participation.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
