<h3>ServeSG</h3>
<p>ServeSG revolutionises volunteering in Singapore, aspiring to elevate
citizen engagement from 22% in 2023 to 50% by 2025. For citizens, ServeSG
facilitates a user-friendly and seamless volunteering journey, tailoring
opportunity recommendations based on their interests, skills, availability,
and location preferences. For organisations, ServeSG not only saves officers
time by digitising manual processes, such as attendance taking, but also
lowers volunteer attrition, by introducing volunteer suitability and behaviour
scores during screening.</p>
