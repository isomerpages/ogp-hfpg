<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Singapore has been facing dwindling volunteerism rates, from 35% in 2016
to 22% in 2021, largely due 3 key factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Existing platforms </strong>are not volunteer-centric with zero
volunteer profiling nor retention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Today’s citizens</strong> are purpose &amp; goal-oriented, with
strong “What’s in it for me” mindsets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Opportunity organisers </strong>lack resources and knowledge to
better engage volunteers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>For citizens, ServeSG is a user-friendly, skill-focused, and interest-based
platform that facilitates a seamless volunteering journey by introducing
opportunity recommendations based on what is important to them - Social
cause interest, skill set utilised, availability, and location preferences.</p>
<p>For organisers, ServeSG saves officers time by digitising the most time-consuming
processes, such as attendance taking, by allowing them to assign a representative
to do so, and volunteer screening, by introducing volunteer suitability
and behaviour scores during screening.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Impact</h4>

is a volunteer. We believe ServeSG, in doing so, will elevate the lives
of those living in Singapore, beneficiary and benefactor alike.</p>
