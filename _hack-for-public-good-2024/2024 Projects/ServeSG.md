<h3>ServeSG</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>ServeSG addresses the pressing challenge of dwindling volunteerism in
Singapore, aiming to reverse the trend and elevate citizen engagement from
22% in 2021 to an impactful 50% by 2025.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>For citizens, ServeSG facilitates a user-friendly and seamless volunteering
journey, tailoring opportunity recommendations based on their interests,
skills, availability, and location preferences. For organisations, ServeSG
not only saves officers time by digitising manual processes, such as attendance
taking, but also lowers volunteer attrition, by introducing volunteer suitability
and behaviour scores during screening.</p>
