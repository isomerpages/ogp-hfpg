<h3>Forge</h3>
<p>Forge is an Internal Developer Portal (IDP) for OGP. It tracks industry
standard operational metrics (DORA metrics for throughput and stability),
which have been shown to be strongly correlated with high productive teams
delivering high quality software.</p>
<p>Tracking DORA metrics can help drive conversations within teams, so they
can decide what they should be focusing on next, and they can validate
if improvements are as expected.
