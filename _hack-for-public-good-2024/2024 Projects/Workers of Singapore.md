<h3>Workers of Singapore</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Migrant workers can pay up to 2 years of their salary to get a job in
Singapore, while knowing little about their job role and the company they’ll
work for. We explored solutions to improve their access to information
about working in Singapore.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>A multilingual information portal that collates safety and salary dispute
records for each company, with potential reviews and job listings in future.
A “choose your story” game to educate players on the pitfalls and potential
ways a worker can be exploited.&nbsp;Check out our prototype <a href="https://workersofsg-r889h7sec-workersofsg.vercel.app/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
