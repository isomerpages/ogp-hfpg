<h3>Magic Form Builder</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>How do we convince officers to reduce paper forms in government? The inspiration
for this started with FormSG’s paperless forms campaign in 2023, where
the team identified that there are still many paper forms in government.
Is the solution then to just simply convince more of these public officers
to use FormSG?&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Our hypothesis is: If we make it easy for public officers to convert forms
or create new forms, naturally they would be more motivated to convert
their workflows digitally. “Doing the right thing should be made simple”!</p>
<p>Hence we built FormSG’s magic form builder to make it simple for public
officers in Singapore to create a form by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Uploading a PDF form</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing a prompt&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Powered by large language models, the magic form builder helps public
officers create an entire form in less than a minute! We believe this is
much quicker than creating every question from scratch, allowing public
officers to focus their efforts on more important parts of form building
(such as data collection and processing)!</p>
