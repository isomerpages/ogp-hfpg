<h3>Magic Form Builder</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>How do we convince officers to reduce paper forms in government? The inspiration
for this started with FormSG‚Äôs paperless forms campaign in 2023, where
the team identified that there are still many paper forms in government.
Is the solution then to just simply convince more of these public officers
to use FormSG?&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Our hypothesis is: If we make it easy for public officers to convert forms
or create new forms, naturally they would be more motivated to convert
their workflows digitally. ‚ÄúDoing the right thing should be made simple‚Äù!</p>
<p>Hence we built FormSG‚Äôs magic form builder to make it simple for public
officers in Singapore to create a form by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Uploading a PDF form</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing a prompt&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Powered by large language models, the magic form builder helps public
officers create an entire form in less than a minute! We believe this is
much quicker than creating every question from scratch, allowing public
officers to focus their efforts on more important parts of form building
(such as data collection and processing)!</p>

<h4>What users are saying?</h4>
<p>Originally, we allowed the public officer to amend the questions and field
types before creating the form (see image). However, this was confusing
hence we removed this to simplify the process.</p>

<p>Some public officers were not sure how to write the prompt, hence we provided
ideas/suggestions in the second iteration which they can click on and fill
the prompt box.</p>

</div>
<p>In addition, there was a waiting time of ~3 minutes during the building
process in the first version, but we managed to reduce that to 1 minute
by improving the prompt engineering and reducing the size of messages.
In order to make the wait time less excruciating, we also designed a cute
GIF to show that ‚Äúyour form is building‚Äù. <em>It is also a play on the words</em> üôÇ.</p>

<p>On hackathon demo day, public officers were able to try out the prototype
in person at our booths. There were a few instances where the prototype
threw an error but it was likely due to the invalid json object generated
by OpenAI. We will be working on those improvements and error flows before
rolling out the Magic Form Builder.</p>
<p>For positive feedback, the officers found the PDF conversion accurate
and quicker! They also thought the prompts were looking up a template repository.
When we shared that the forms were generated by the LLM in that instance,
they were very impressed!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most common question we got was ‚Äúcan we use it now, when can we use
it?‚Äù A total of 30+ public officers have expressed interest to use the
Magic form builder that day.</p>
