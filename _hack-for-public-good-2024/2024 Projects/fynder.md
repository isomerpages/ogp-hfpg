<h3>fynder</h3>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>fynder is a platform that allows public officers to borrow things within
their agencies quickly, easily and effectively.</p>
<p>The result is a stop solution for public officers to find items fast,
request for them, pick them up and drop them off.</p>
<p>Of course, we didn’t forget our asset manager, they will be presented
with an overview of their asset movements, approval flow and email notifications!</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The team started with a simple question; how can we encourage the sharing
of items within one’s agency, and how can we make the process simple and
seamless for those who are doing it already?</p>
<p>We focused on items discoverability as the epicentre of the solution and
discovered that a listing page suits our exact needs! To validate our approach,
we did the following things;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We spoke to officers from different domains; SCDF &amp; MOE on how often
they have to borrow items.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We learnt that the officers from these agencies often borrow things for
a magnitude of reasons but the current process of trying to find items
has been similar - painful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The officers shared the same experience when trying to borrow, this can
be summarised with the following sharing:
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We looked online to find potential solutions, many solutions were tackling
tracking assets. However, some solutions that were tackling the problem
of discoverability weren’t too great with it user experience which was
very important in this problem space.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Another issue with most solutions was that most inputs/actions were done
by the asset managers only.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We wanted to bridge the gap and bring both the “requester” and the “asset
manager” on a single platform as a source of truth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Product Goals</h4>
<p>As a team, we were clear on our goals;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Discoverability: </strong>To ensure officers were able to find
items FAST!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seamless: </strong>To ensure that officers can borrow items while
retaining accountability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Awareness: </strong>The ability to show asset managers where their
items are at a glance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>The team was clear on our execution; a listing page layered with asset
tracking:
<br>We tested our 2 weeks old product with a couple of officers to test how
easy it was to discover and request items on fynder:</p>
<p>Here’s a testimonial from an officer:
<br>
</p>
<p>User Ratings:
<br>After having done over 11 user tests, we concluded that our solution is
way better than what is made available here. This is even though the product
created is an MVP with barebones features.</p>
<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>We built an end-to-end product in just 3 weeks for the Hack for Public
Good 2024!</p>
