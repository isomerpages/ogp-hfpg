<h3>Fynder</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Government departments purchase things separately, leading to wasteful
spending and inefficiency. They often duplicate purchases, and this decentralized
system needs to use resources better.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Fynder fixes this by creating a central platform. It helps departments
share resources, avoid duplicates, and track everything in real time. This
makes government operations more efficient, saves money, and is better
for the environment. Reach out to us to get started: <a href="mailto:fynder@open.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">fynder@open.gov.sg</a>
