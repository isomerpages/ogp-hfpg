<h3>RoadBuster</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Low accuracy of the existing license plate identification system has resulted
in significant manual effort on the part of Traffic Police officers. How
might we improve the accuracy of identifying license plate details, so
that Traffic Police officers can do other higher value-added work?</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>RoadBuster uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to identify licence
plate numbers and reduce the time taken for Traffic Police officers to
confirm red light and speeding offences, making the roads safer for everyone.
The prototype is a back-end admin interface and dashboard for officers
to confirm licence plate details from traffic camera images.</p>
