<h3>RoadBuster</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Low accuracy of current Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system to
read traffic camera images to identify license plates of vehicles suspected
of speeding and running through red lights. This results in significant
manual effort on the part of Traffic Police officers. How might we improve
the accuracy of identifying license plate details, so that Traffic Police
officers can do other higher value-added work?</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>RoadBuster uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to identify licence
plate numbers and reduce the time taken for Traffic Police officers to
confirm red light and speeding offences, making the roads safer for everyone.
The prototype is a back-end admin interface and dashboard for officers
to confirm licence plate details from traffic camera images. Read more
