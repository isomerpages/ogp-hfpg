<h3><strong>AskHer</strong></h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Many women struggle to find healthcare professionals that deeply empathise
with their reproductive health issues and offer quality solutions. Women
have taken to informal online communities to seek help from other women
to find better doctors and understand their health issues, because existing
solutions aren’t good enough. It also does not help that women’s health
issues are taboo until women are married. Worse, there is low visibility
of the scale of the problem, because women despite comprising ~50% of the
population aren’t prioritised.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>The team has thus built a comprehensive online platform (“AskHer”) that
provides verified women reviews on private clinics, and well-written content
that empowers women to truly take control of their reproductive health.
Through AskHer, we want to make information on women’s health and women’s
healthcare providers more accessible, transparent, and useful for women
in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes AskHer different from existing solutions?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A potential integration with Singpass and our Health Appointment System
(HAS) means that we are able to verify that reviews are written by <em>real</em> individuals,
while still being able to keep their identities hidden. This will encourage
users to leave more <em>genuine </em>and <em>helpful reviews.&nbsp;</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compared to existing private sector solutions, AskHer is a government-run
solution which offers greater objectivity. Absence of the profit-motive
means users will have a reliable, trustworthy website they can go to for
information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compared to existing public sector solutions, AskHer aims to present information
in a more user-friendly, digestible, and transparent format. We hope this
can increase general public awareness of women’s health issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>

All reviews and summaries on the platform have been generated for illustrative
purposes only and do not reflect any experiences at actual clinics.</p>
