<h3>CareerSG</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Today it takes at least 20 minutes to submit an application on the government's
main job application portal, Careers@Gov. Improvements in areas such as
search accuracy and overall user experience could help increase its functionality
and reduce job application times.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Weâ€™ve built a portal for citizens to quickly and accurately search for
roles and view all job information transparently, significantly enhancing
the applicant experience. It will take you just two minutes and a single
click on 'Apply with LinkedIn' to successfully apply for a role.</p>
<p>Through removing barriers to application, we hope to hire more talents
into Government &amp; through these talents, make Singapore better.</p>
