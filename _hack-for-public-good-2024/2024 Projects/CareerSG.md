<h3>CareerSG</h3>
<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Today all Government job postings are posted centrally on the Careers@Gov
job portal, which contains <strong>2.3k+ job listings across 116 Government agencies</strong>.
A straw poll that we did with Recruiters from 10+ agencies during the Tech
for Public Good bootcamp indicates that almost <strong>90% of hires in Government</strong> today
come from online applications, hence this is a critical channel that we
need to get right.</p>
<p>Currently, It takes at least <strong>20 minutes to submit an application</strong> on
the government's main job application portal, Careers@Gov. There are multiple
barriers to application where you have to create an account, do a 2FA authentication
and fill in a <strong>minimum of 35 application fields</strong> to apply
for 1 role.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>search results aren’t accurate</strong> which makes it difficult
to navigate through the 2k+ roles posted. Improvements in search accuracy
and overall user experience are needed to help increase its functionality
and reduce job application times.</p>
<p>In short, the main hiring channel is not able to extract it's maximum
yield due to barriers to apply.</p>
<h4>Product Goals</h4>
<p>We wanted to create an improved job application portal that focuses on
the 3 key attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> To ensure that the search results &amp; role
identification is accurate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> To ensure that all important job information
e.g salary is transparent to help candidate’s make an informed decision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The application experience is simple, with
low barriers to application</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Our Approach</h4>
<p>We did research against top tech companies &amp; their job application
portals to identify what were important features to have &amp; what a good
user journey/experience would look like.</p>
<p>We also compared against companies who were famed for their customer experience
e.g Singapore airlines and analysed their customer service form experience
to identify important components of a good form filling experience</p>
<p>We also compared against samples sites that the backend applicant tracking
system (ATS) shared and companies e.g <a href="http://Booking.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Booking.com</a> &amp; OKX who were using Greenhouse
as their Recruitment ATS systems to see what customisation options were
possible.</p>
<h4>User Testing</h4>
<p>We tested with 7 users who fulfilled the following criteria:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>General working population aged 21 years &amp; above</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking for full time or part time roles&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have work experience so that they could meaningfully comment on the application
experience</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal was to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Understand the mental model of how people would search for job openings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Validate the navigation and information architecture of landing page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gather insights on overall interaction and get suggestions on what could
be done to elevate the user experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find out more about both pleasant and unpleasant application experiences
from job seekers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback we gathered was incorporated into several iterations of our prototype
i.e changing colour themes, search bar behaviour, information displayed,
‘apply button design’, placement of ‘agency &amp; department’ categories
before our final solution (below)</p>
<h4>Our Final Solution</h4>
<p>We’ve built a job portal <a href="https://careers.hack.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> for citizens to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Quickly and accurately search for roles and view all job information transparently,
significantly enhancing the applicant experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It takes you just two minutes and a single click on 'Apply with LinkedIn'
to successfully apply for a role with a maximum of 5 application fields
needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Role information is transparent &amp; you can easily filter by department
&amp; agency types to find your desired role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All this is linked to a Recruitment applicant tracking system (Greenhouse)
on the backend which Recruiters will then use to process the candidates
&amp; take them through the hiring journey.
<br>
</p>
<p>Through removing barriers to application, we hope to hire more talents
into Government &amp; through these talents, make Singapore better.</p>

</ul>

<h4>User Feedback</h4>
<p>Categorized feedback from users:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The new visual design &amp; layout is clean and easy to read</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information displayed on the site is good, standard with what is seen
across other job sites</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search function &amp; dropdown select is more useful vs the current multi-select
bar at C@G</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seems mobile optimised &amp; good latency in load times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much easier to apply for a job now, the one touch apply via LinkedIn easily
extracts all information in my profile, reduces manual effort</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a Recruiter, because I'm familiar and know that its hosted on the Greenhouse
platform, it feels good as I've used this ATS before</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Job information is good &amp; transparent but some concerns on listing
salary information</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Our Rollout Plan</h4>
<p>We already have traction where post the Tech for Public Good (TFPG) bootcamp
in 2023, we have approval from the Public Service Division (PSD) to trial
a new applicant tracking system (Greenhouse) with a pilot group of 6 agencies
(SNDGO, DOTC, IMDA, NLB, ESTL &amp; PSD).&nbsp;This is already up and running
and these agencies will be connecting their job postings on the ATS to
the new front end job site.</p>
<p>From Demo day, 5 more agencies have expressed interest (MOF, PIC, SportSG,
NCSS &amp; GovTech) to join the pilot program.</p>
<p>For the next phase, we will be expanding the pilot to these 5 agencies
+ exploring onboarding MOE &amp; MHA, who have legacy based Recruiting
processes onto the new platform.</p>
<p><strong>Future planned features of the website includes:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Filter by salary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filter &amp; sort by date posted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filter by Job types (Full time/Part Time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Job alerts of new roles that fit your search criteria</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing feature of roles to your social media</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to bookmark favorite jobs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to track your application
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to A/B pilot trial with these agencies to list their roles
onto our new platform whilst keeping their current postings on Careers@Gov
and to compare key metrics:
<br>- Application rates
<br>- Application conversion rates
<br>- Application drop off rates
<br>- Candidate application satisfaction
<br>- Agency user satisfaction</p>
