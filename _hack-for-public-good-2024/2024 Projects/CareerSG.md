<h3>CareerSG</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Today it takes at least 20 minutes to submit an application on the government's
main job application portal, Careers@Gov. There are multiple barriers to
application where you have to create an account, do a 2FA authentication
and fill in a minimum of 35 application fields to apply for 1 role. Search
results aren’t accurate which makes it difficult to navigate through the
2k+ roles posted. Improvements in&nbsp; search accuracy and overall user
experience are needed to help increase its functionality and reduce job
application times.</p>
<h4>Product Goals</h4>
<p>We wanted to create an improved job application portal that focuses on
the 3 key attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> To ensure that the search results &amp; role
identification is accurate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> To ensure that all important job information
e.g salary is transparent to help candidate’s make an informed decision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The application experience is simple, with
low barriers to application</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Our Approach</h4>
<p>We did research against top tech companies &amp; their job application
portals to identify what were important features to have &amp; what a good
user journey/experience would look like.
<br>
<br>We also compared against companies who were famed for their customer experience
e.g Singapore airlines and analysed their customer service form experience
to identify what made good customer experience.</p>
<p>We rapidly prototyped and churned out various iterations of our new job
portal and user testing from both the applicant’s &amp; agency HR user’s
perspective to get quick feedback and incorporated it into our product.</p>
<h4>Our Final Solution</h4>
<p>We’ve built a portal for citizens to quickly and accurately search for
roles and view all job information transparently, significantly enhancing
the applicant experience. It will take you just two minutes and a single
click on 'Apply with LinkedIn' to successfully apply for a role with a
maximum of 5 application fields needed. Role information is transparent
&amp; you can easily filter by department &amp; agency types to find your
desired role.
<br>
<br>Through removing barriers to application, we hope to hire more talents
into Government &amp; through these talents, make Singapore better.</p>

<h4>Our Rollout Plan</h4>
<p>We’ve sought approval from the Public Service Division (PSD) to trial
the new job portal and backend applicant tracking system with a pilot group
of 6 agencies (SNDGO, DOTC, IMDA, NLB, ESTL &amp; PSD).&nbsp;</p>
<p>From Demo day, 5 more agencies have expressed interest (MOF, PIC, SportSG,
NCSS &amp; GovTech).</p>
<p>For the next phase, we will be expanding the pilot to these 5 agencies
+ exploring onboarding MOE &amp; MHA, who have legacy based Recruiting
processes onto the new platform.
<br>
<br>The goal is to A/B pilot trial with these agencies to list their roles
onto our new platform whilst keeping their current postings on Careers@Gov
and to compare key metrics:
<br>- Application rates
<br>- Application conversion rates
<br>- Application drop off rates
<br>- Candidate application satisfaction
<br>- Agency user satisfaction</p>
