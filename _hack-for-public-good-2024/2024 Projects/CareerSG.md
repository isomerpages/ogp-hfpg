<h3>CareerSG</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>The main job application portal, Careers@Gov today could use with improvements
in its functionality, such as search accuracy, and overall user experience,
where it currently takes 20 minutes to submit a job application.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Weâ€™ve built a portal for citizens to quickly and accurately search for
roles and view all job information transparently, significantly enhancing
the applicant experience. It will take you just two minutes and a single
click on 'Apply with LinkedIn' to successfully apply for a role.</p>
<p>Through removing barriers to application, we hope to hire more talents
into Government &amp; through these talents, make Singapore better.</p>
