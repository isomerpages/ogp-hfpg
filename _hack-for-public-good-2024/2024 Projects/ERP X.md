<h3>ERP X</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>ERP gantries are at the end of their shelf lives, and ERP 2.0’s 3-part
hardware is clunky, outdated and expensive (&gt;$556 mil).</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>ERP X reimagines what ERP might have been. It uses Optical Character Recognition
to read license plates, and charges and notifies drivers immediately when
they have paid ERP charges on the ERP X app. In short, ERP X is a straightforward,
cost-effective and real-time solution for road pricing and may avoid the
installation of On-Board Units in 1 million vehicles.</p>
