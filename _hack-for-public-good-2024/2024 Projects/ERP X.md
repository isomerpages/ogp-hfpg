<h3>ERP X</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>ERP X is a conversation starter to explore one possible way in which ERP
could be alternatively implemented. It is a reaction to the public reception
of ERP 2.0, and an attempt to prototype a better and cheaper solution.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>In this example, we’ve used machine learning and optical character recognition
to read license plates from video streams. We tested this with our mobile
phones and regular webcams from our office, but in reality it should be
implemented with proper traffic cameras.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We built a mobile app that allows drivers to register multiple vehicles
and set up fully automated credit card payments. In this way, they can
immediately be told how much they’ve been charged when they drive through
an ERP area. We could also use this to serve enforcement fines, such as
speeding or red light tickets, or processing vehicles and monitoring wait
times at border crossings.</p>
