<h3>Save My Trash</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Singaporeâ€™s domestic recycling rates have remained low (12%) over the
past decade. We found that while most residents are motivated to recycle
(63% of survey respondents), they do not recycle enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recycling-conscious residents lack knowledge and confidence on what items
can be recycled, how items should be processed for recycling and where
to recycle, resulting in the overall process being tedious and time consuming
today.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>We want to increase recycling amongst recycling-conscious residents. This
is done by addressing their key challenges with a web app that optimises
user experience and provides a one-step search on how to recycle an item.</p>
<p>With a single search, recycling-conscious residents can instantly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check if an item can be recycled or not;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receive step-by-step instructions for recycling an item to simplify process;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand why an item cannot be recycled to boost recycling confidence;
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check for nearby recycling bins and get directions to act on their recycling
intention.</p>
</li>
</ul>
