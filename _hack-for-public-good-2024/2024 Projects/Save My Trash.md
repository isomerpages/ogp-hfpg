<h3>Save My Trash</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>There is a myriad of possible reasons why the household recycling rate
in Singapore is low, but two reasons that stood out to us were the accessibility
and findability of recycling points, as well as the lack of awareness on
what can be recycled.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Our solution points you to critical information when it comes to recycling
- 1) can something be recycled, 2) what you need to do before throwing
it, and 3) where can you throw it - in a simple way. Let Trashee help your
recyclables find their homes! Check out our prototype <a href="https://www.recycle.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
