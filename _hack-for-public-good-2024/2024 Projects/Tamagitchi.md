<h3>Tamagitchi</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Our developers are generally biased towards certain activities over the
others (i.e. writing code implementation over reviewing code) which causes
our velocity to be limited sometimes.</p>
<p>It can take anywhere from <strong>a few days to 2 weeks</strong> for a pull
request to be looked at, delaying the feature rollout.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>We created a tamagotchi-like extension to the common text editor that
our engineers use in the team - VSCode. Engineers can grow this tamagitchi
pet to different levels by contributing to the code repositories of OGP.
We reward more for activities that we want to promote. The cherry-on-top
for this extension is the chat room ability where engineers using the extensions
can see each other's pet and do real-time chatting.</p>
