<h3>Watson</h3>
<p>Watson lets you talk to your data, translating complex numbers into valuable
insights that anyone can understand. From analysing your datasets to breaking
it down into everyday language and visualisations, Watson helps you do
it all—no database language or coding knowledge needed!</p>
<h4><strong>Problem</strong></h4>
<p>Members of Public (MOPs) and even public officers are not able to use
and draw insights from government data to support important life decisions.
For people with limited training in database languages or coding, making
data accessible and understandable called for an everyday solution.</p>
<h4><strong>What we built</strong></h4>
<p>With AI becoming an increasingly familiar tool for general use, we created
Watson—an AI chatbot that lets anyone ask questions and gain data-driven
insights. We focused on HDB resale data, as a relevant dataset for the
majority of MOPs.</p>
<p>The general idea was to start as a Large Language Learning (LLM) wrapper—where
we feed Watson the metadata of a single table such as the column names,
datatypes, and definitions. Users can write a question against the dataset
in natural language, and we generate a SQL query using the metadata. We
then use this SQL query to query the dataset, and finally, return a natural
response!</p>
<h4><strong>The result</strong></h4>
<p>From the average resale flat size to the month-on-month price trend of
flats, Watson analyses the HDB dataset to give users answers to their questions.
All in language they can understand!</p>
<p>With additional features, users can also visualise data, explore the full
dataset, make use of suggested prompts, and rate Watson’s responses.</p>

<h4><strong>What users had to say</strong></h4>
<p><strong>GovTech:</strong>
</p>
<p>Would like to sync up. I'm am leading the development of a similar LLM
app in AGD called "AI for FI". "AI for FI" aims to empower officers and
data analysts to generate their analysis more efficiently and accurately,
by providing them with a more intuitive way to access and analyze finance
data.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce Singapore:</strong>
</p>
<p>I'm building something similar (and coincidentally called SHERLOCK). haha</p>
<p>Would love to trade notes, and thinking on how best to use azure openai's
code interpreter.</p>
<p>it's already deployed.</p>
<p><strong>Hackathon feedback:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Would be cool to upload my own data to analyse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would be interesting to use internally to deload data teams</p>
</li>
</ol>
