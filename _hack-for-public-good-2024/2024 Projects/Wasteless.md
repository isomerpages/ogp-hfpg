<h3>Wasteless</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Singapore trashes over 2 million kilograms of food daily and only recycles
18%. Essential food items like rice, noodles, and bread contribute significantly
to this waste, further impacting the 10.4% of surveyed households experiencing
food insecurity.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Our user-friendly web app aims to be a comprehensive one-stop platform
with features tackling the food waste problem at each stage of the food
life cycle.&nbsp;</p>
