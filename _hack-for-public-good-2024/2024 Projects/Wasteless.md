<h3>Wasteless</h3>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a way to help other people in the community who may benefit from
our extra groceries and allow them to be able to donate it in a very convenient
manner?</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Singapore trashes over 2 million kilograms of food daily (<em>roughly equivalent to two million bags of rice</em>)
and only recycles 18% of this food waste. A significant contributing source
is essential food items like rice, noodles and bread, which could have
been re-channelled to the 10.4% of surveyed households that experience
food insecurity in Singapore today instead.</p>
<p>(See more details <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XJSoueVQlEF7P-2ZOZtrz9VlCYfYUnYWHbKprr9_-zA/edit#slide=id.g264a7a38d6d_0_4" class="c-link c-link--focus-visible" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>We have built a no-code web app in lieu of having no engineers on our
team that targets the food waste problem at various stage of the food life
cycle with the following envisioned features:</p>
<p></p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A portion calculator</strong> 
<br>Reduces excess food being generated at top of the funnel.
<br><em>Note: This was sourced from an existing open-source product but would be the closest to what we have in mind, but adapted to the local food context</em>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A map of food donation avenues</strong> (food bank, food donation
boxes, community fridges etc.)
<br>Gives people more information on where they can donate their food before
it expires / turns bad. This aims to decrease food waste by increasing
food donation rates.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Food storage tips</strong> 
<br>To arm people with the knowledge to extend the shelf life of their food
before it turns bad</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI-powered recipe generator</strong> 
<br>To help people find creative ways to use their leftover ingredients instead
of trashing it.
