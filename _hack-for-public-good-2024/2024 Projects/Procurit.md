<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>In the current landscape of procurement, agencies have cumbersome processes
that significantly delay project timelines and decision-making. The absence
of a unified system means&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There's no clear guidance on the steps required for procurement. Buyers
find it difficult to understand what are the next steps while procurement
managers spend significant time in education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of audit-ready trails, leading to repetitive efforts and confusion
over who's done what.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heavy reliance on email and spreadsheets for tracking, creating a breeding
ground for human errors and compliance rework.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The emphasis on adhering strictly to process compliance, often exceeds
MOF’s guidelines, shifting the focus away from achieving the best outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Procurit and its mascot bork introduces a simplified approach by offering
a guided, systematic journey that navigates users effortlessly through
each step of the process. Here’s how we’re addressing the core challenges.</p>
<p><strong>For Buyers</strong>: We're simplifying procurement with a system
that's as straightforward as following instructions, ensuring anyone can
manage procurement tasks without prior knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>For Procurement Teams</strong>: Procurit is designed to drastically
reduce the time spent on manual guidance and minimise human errors.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We aim to streamline operations and ensure compliance while reducing the
back and forth as well as requests falling through the cracks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our platform acts as the single source of truth for audits and budget
tracking, eliminating the dependency on disjointed tools like email and
spreadsheets.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also offer the customisation required at each agency level over the
baseline MOF-approved workflow.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Leadership and Approvers</strong>: We enhance visibility and
streamline the approval process. We also aim to provide a single view for
the department heads to understand more about their expenditure, how their
departments procurement requests are faring over time and identify bottlenecks.</p>
<h4>Our Approach</h4>
<p><strong>Guided Workflow</strong>: A form-based workflow that specifies
requirements at each step, including necessary approvals and document submissions.</p>
<p><strong>Timely Reminders</strong>: Our bork proactively sends reminders
for requests that have been pending for too long, ensuring no task falls
through the cracks.</p>
<p><strong>Customisable Agency Workflows</strong>: While maintaining a foundation
based on MOF guidelines, we offer agencies the ability to customise workflows
to better fit their needs.</p>
<p><strong>Activity and Audit Records</strong>: We provide a clear overview
of financial expenditure, procurement activities, and the status of requests,
making it easier to track and manage contracts and renewals.</p>
