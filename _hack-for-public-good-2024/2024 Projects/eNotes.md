<h3>eNotes</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>How might we ensure that our loved ones are informed about what to do
in unforeseen events, such as incapacitation or death, when we are no longer
able to guide them? Traditional wills are cumbersome and costly, while
commercial apps (note-taking/messaging) often lack security and certainty
of access.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Emergency Notes (eNotes) enables you to leave straightforward instructions
for your loved ones in three simple steps: Log in using Singpass, write
a note, and choose whom to send it to and when (either upon incapacitation/death
or immediately). When triggered, your loved ones will simply need to verify
their identity through Singpass to access the note.</p>
