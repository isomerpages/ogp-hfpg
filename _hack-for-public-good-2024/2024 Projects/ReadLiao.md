<h3>ReadLiao</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Many senior citizens face significant challenges in comprehending complicated
letters sent in English, be it for healthcare matters, legal matters, or
even basic daily communications.</p>
<p>Apart from language barriers and declining cognitive abilities, complex
sentence structures and large bodies of text also pose substantial obstacles
to seniors' comprehension, leading to confusion, frustration, and a sense
of helplessness when dealing with long-form written content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, *100% of seniors we’ve interviewed leave letters and documents
to their caregivers or social workers to decipher, making them completely
dependent on others to understand essential information. Yet, it costs
the Government S$70 million each year to print and mail letters - letters
that senior citizens in particular don’t read.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we make letters make sense for them?</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Powered by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Large Language Model
(LLM), ReadLiao transforms the reading experience for senior citizens.
Our product deciphers long-form letters and documents, to provide clear
and contextualized content that is easy for seniors to understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With integrated language translations and audio prompts, ReadLiao not
only enhances comprehension for seniors but also ensures inclusivity across
languages and literacy abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe in making information accessible to all, and ReadLiao is the
key to unlocking a world of clarity for seniors, one letter at a time.</p>
