<h3>ReadLiao</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Many senior citizens face significant challenges in comprehending complicated
letters sent in English, be it for healthcare matters, legal matters, or
even basic daily communications.</p>
<p>Apart from language barriers and declining cognitive abilities, complex
sentence structures and large bodies of text also pose substantial obstacles
to seniors' comprehension, leading to confusion, frustration, and a sense
of helplessness when dealing with long-form written content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, *100% of seniors we’ve interviewed leave letters and documents
to their caregivers or social workers to decipher, making them completely
dependent on others to understand essential information. Yet, it costs
the Government S$70 million each year to print and mail letters - letters
that senior citizens in particular don’t read.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we make letters make sense for them?</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>We conducted 2 rounds of research with 17 seniors. In the first round
we validated the use case of readliao and concluded that seniors have a
need to help them decipher complicated government letters. Our second round
of research showcases the flow of simplifying letters and translating it
into mandarin. All 10 seniors we tested found it useful, agreed that it
makes letters easier to understand and are likely to recommend this to
fellow seniors. Seniors were particularly impressed with the product’s
ability to address user pain points like font size of letters (by allowing
users to zoom into text) and ability to convert speech-to-text.&nbsp;</p>
