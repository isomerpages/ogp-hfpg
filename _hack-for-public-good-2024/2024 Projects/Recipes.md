<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Recipes aims to help public officers who believe in the idea of digitizing
processes but don't have the awareness, skills, or time to digitize common
workflows that require multiple OGP products to solve.</p>
<p>Our events, documentation, and demos may inspire them, but the effort
required to get started can be perceived to be more than alternative solutions.
Some may turn to their IT department for help or go through procurement
processes to engage professional services and continue to focus on what's
important in their role.</p>
<p>Recipes aims to lower the comparable effort with quick-start templates
and empower public officers to digitize their workflow across multiple
OGP products.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>The power of Recipes is in the quantity of templates available to solve
common problems. We gathered common use cases from problem statements,
existing automations in use by other agencies, feature requests, and private
sector inspiration.</p>
<p>For the Hackathon, we started with a handful of examples:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A customizable attendance tracker for your events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A way to track assets or book rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collecting and forwarding feedback from users to a platform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enforcement of fines with mailing payment links</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>How It Works</h4>
<p>Public officers can browse Recipes for one of our templates that solve
a problem they have, test it out with a demo, and continue to customize
it for their own use.</p>
<p>At this point, the ideal solution would automate the duplication of the
templates into the user's respective application accounts, but in the interest
of developing an MVP for the Hackathon, we added additional steps to duplicate
a template manually and share the API key.</p>
<p>Even with this friction, a user unfamiliar with how to use both our products
could develop a prototype to solve their problem in a matter of minutes
after completing a few steps.</p>
<p>After that point, users can test or customize further using OGP's products.</p>
<p><strong>The purpose of Recipes is to lower the bar to solving common problems that require the use of multiple OGP products. While we created a proof-of-concept for the Hackathon, please connect with OGP if you would like to share your use case.</strong>
