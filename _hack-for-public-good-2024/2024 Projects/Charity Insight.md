<h3>Charity Insight</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>92% of donations in Singapore are directed towards large charities, while
smaller charities do not receive as much funding as a result of limited
resources to conduct public outreach.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Charity Insight is a charity portal designed to provide the public with
a centralised platform for discovering underfunded yet impactful charities.
By offering detailed insights and information, this portal empowers individuals
to make well-informed decisions when choosing charities to support through
donations.</p>
