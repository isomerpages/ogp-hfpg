<h3>Charity Insight</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>92% of donations in Singapore are directed towards large charities with
annual receipts exceeding $10 million. (MCCY COC Report 2022) This leaves
smaller charities, which are often engaged in meaningful and impactful
work, with limited resources for marketing and outreach. Consequently,
these smaller charities receive less visibility and funding. Conversely,
potential donors, such as Members of the Public (MOPs), express a desire
to support underfunded charities, but struggle to identify them. How can
we bridge this discoverability gap and facilitate connections between underfunded
charities and potential donors?</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Charity Insight is a charity portal designed to bridge this discoverability
gap by providing the public with a centralised platform for discovering
underfunded yet impactful charities. By offering detailed insights and
information, this portal empowers individuals to make well-informed decisions
when choosing charities to support through donations.</p>
