<h3>KampungSpirit</h3>
<h4>Premise</h4>
<p>Less fortunate families in Singapore need essential items, but they're
very difficult for single donors to help with. What if we could get 10,000
donors to help?&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's the idea behind <a href="https://kampungspirit.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>KampungSpirit</u></a>, a space where
the entire village (or 'kampung' in Malay) can chip in to buy things like
rice cookers, washing machines, milk/diapers (and more!) for households
in dire need of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are families under the care of social workers, who vet each item
that goes on the platform.</p>

<h4>Status (as of 15 Feb 2024)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$12.6k raised from 139 unique donors in 20 days</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>37 requests fulfilled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>35 FSCs listing items on KS, 14 already benefited from funded listings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>220 subscribers in telegram</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal was to raise enough to fulfill 5 items by the end of the month,
but we launched quite late, on 26th Jan 2024</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>By 31st Jan 2024 (5 days later), we had already raised $3k, and funded
13 items</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Background info</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>47 FSCs, ~15 SWs per FSC, 40 cases each</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>28,200 in-need households in SG, out of a 1.7M total</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in contrast, 1.7M households in SG. So 28,200 is not even 2% of all households
in SG.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bottom 10% of households earned $2,314 monthly, while the top 10%
earned $31,430 monthly</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our hypotheses: The general public can more than cover the needs of the
bottom 10%. $200 for a wheelchair is a lot for 1 donor, but just 20c for
a kampung of 1,000.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And so far the hypothesis has been proven true. 90% of donations came
from people who are not direct friends and family, but who were moved by
the stories we told on KampungSpirit.</p>
