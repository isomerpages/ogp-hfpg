<h3>KampungSpirit</h3>
<h4>Problem </h4>
<p>Less fortunate families in Singapore need essential items, but they're
very difficult for singular donors to help with. What if we could get 10,000
donors to help?&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>That's the idea behind <a href="https://kampungspirit.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">KampungSpirit</a>, a platform where
an entire village (or 'kampung' in Malay) can chip in to buy things like
rice cookers, washing machines, milk, diapers and more, for households
who are in dire need of them. These are families under the care of social
workers, who also vet each item that go on the platform.</p>
