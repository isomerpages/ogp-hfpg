<h3>Roster Monster</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Overworked healthcare professionals, including doctors, may spend at least
5 hours each month planning complex rosters alongside their core duties.
This process involves gathering leave and shift requests from their colleagues,
ensuring shift requirements are met, and striving for fairness. Addressing
this issue is crucial to allow them to dedicate more time to their primary
role: providing the best possible care for their patients.</p>
<p>The rostering problem bares its fangs outside of the healthcare space
as well. Be it scheduling instructors with different expertises for classes
or ensuring that a lifeguard-trained personnel is always on shift at the
pool, rosters form the backbone of operations in many institutions.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Roster Monster is an automated roster generation tool that seeks to remove
the manual puzzle-solving aspect of roster planning. We achieve this through
the use of a constraint satisfaction solver that will look for the optimal
solution while satisfying all the rules specified by the user.
<br>
<br>While other automated scheduling systems exist, a common pain point with
their use is the inability to customise roster rules without going through
lengthy and costly change requests with the vendor. Constraint satisfaction
solvers generally require rules to be specified in a technical format that
is inaccessible to the average roster planner. With every department or
organisation having their own unique set of rules that evolve over time,
rolling out a system that does not allow for intuitive customisation by
the users themselves will require extensive manual intervention during
setup and change requests.</p>
<p>That is why we have made rule customisation the core tenet of Roster Monster,
where we seek to empower roster planners by bridging the gap between the
user and the solver using good design.</p>
