#### What is Queue
Allows citizens to queue and monitor their positions digitally while organisers manage the queue via drag-and-drop

#### What motivated you to build this product?
Queuing up for stuff is part of being a Singaporean. However, queuing and maintain social distancing is hard. Digital queues could easily replace physical lines and allow people to be present when necessary. However, such solutions are not readily available to SMEs or non-digital organisations. The team goal was to develop a queue system that hassle-free with low maintenance and cost.


#### You identified design as the most challenging part of the process. Why?
Every queue had slightly different requirements. The challenge was to build a system that allowed for customisation while maintaining its simplicity to ensure that anyone who used it could fit it into their use case. An example of this is a queue for the collection of a goodie bag versus a visit to a polyclinic. The former would need to know your NRIC and requires a single queue line to call and collect. While the latter would need to assign queue numbers and have multiple queue lines e.g registration, consultation, pharmacy and payment.


#### Fun facts!
**One interesting finding:**\\
We managed to re-purpose Trello a project management software as a queue software.

**One thing you're most proud of accomplishing:**\\
We simplified the onboarding in a way that a non-technical person could do it themselves. It takes four steps and around 10 minutes to set up a queue with zero coding knowledge involved. It reduces the hurdle for anyone to adopt a digital queue system.

**One thing you'd have done differently:**\\
We developed the initial prototype that was geared to a single-use case that led to some re-development. The team could have attempted to generalise the product features more.
