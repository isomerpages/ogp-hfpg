#### What is whosyourkaki?
Buddy matching system in your neighbourhood.

#### What motivated you to build this product?
The impact that kampongkaki produces is great, however, their current process involves quite a significant amount of manual work. I would say to helping automate the process and free up their time to work on more important things is the main motivation point.
 

The problem we were trying to solve was to make the onboarding process better for volunteers and also eliminate the need of having matchmakers manually the script on the system every week.

#### What tech stack did you use?

NextJS for frontend, NestJS for backend, Flask for matching API and Chakra UI for ui/css framework.

#### What were the key challenges you faced in building whosyourkaki? 

For engineering, the key challenges are making it mobile friendly and backend would be integration the integration with sgid. Designing how the matching algorithm would work as a separate service from the backend.
 

For design, thinking through the implications of the product & design when it came to identity and beneficiaries' safety.
 

For product, we're still unsure how volunteers would react to the matching system.

#### What is the product vision for whosyourkaki? 
We believe there could be a couple of NGOs requiring some sort of matchmaking system. This could be a useful example for these NGOs to reference.

#### Fun facts!
**One interesting finding:**\\

Not all beneficiaries require physical support but rather mental support such as having a volunteer over to their place just to chit chat.

**One thing you'd have done differently:**\\

We would want to interview more volunteers and beneficiaries to check whether were there any gaps our product have missed.

**Takeaway/learnings:**\\

Thankfully, there is a surplus of volunteers in this project entirely and this shines a bright light that there are a lot more people wanting to do good. However, one of the bigger issues is the lack of suitable skills from volunteers.
