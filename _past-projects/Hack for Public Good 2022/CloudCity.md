#### What is CloudCity?
A cloud sandbox for government services.

#### What motivated you to build this product?
We wanted to be able to provide everyone who took part in Hack for Public Good an AWS cloud environment but in a controlled manner.

#### What tech stack did you use?
AWS - Control Tower, Single Sign-On, Landing Zone, Security Hub.

#### What were the key challenges you faced in building CloudCity? 
Our main challenges were on operating higher-order cloud services in a federated account setup, and communicating clearly to users on the guardrails provided by CloudCity.


#### What is the product vision for CloudCity? 
We envision that other tech teams within the government will be able to leverage the cloud sandbox for their projects.

#### Fun facts!
**One interesting finding:**\\
Many engineers were very excited about being able to experiment in their own personal AWS accounts on CloudCity. Previously, we only had a single team-wide AWS account for this, which impeded learning and experimentation because of high friction due to quota limits and overlapping infrastructure.

**One thing you'd have done differently:**\\
We would be able to discover more cloud features e.g. AWS Audit Manager, and figure out how to write additional custom service control policies tailored to our governance use cases.

**Takeaway/learnings:**\\
Good cloud governance does not necessarily mean limiting engineering freedom.
