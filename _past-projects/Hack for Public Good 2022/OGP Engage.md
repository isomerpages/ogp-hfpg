#### What is OGP Engage?
Engage with OGP officers on Telegram!

#### What motivated you to build this product?
We realised there is a lack of ad-hoc communication between OGP and agencies on the ground level. The problem we're trying to solve is to bridge the gap with the messaging app, Telegram.

#### What tech stack did you use?
Telegram.

#### What were the key challenges you faced in building OGP Engage? 

Getting users to join our telegram group chat was and still is the challenge.

#### What is the product vision for OGP Engage? 
If each product in OGP starts to get a large amount of users, we can create a Telegram group chat for each of this product to better engage with users directly to understand their pain points and use cases better.

#### Fun facts!
**One interesting finding:**

Cpf.gov.sg actually built something similar to go.gov.sg. Something that we weren't aware of.

**One thing you'd have done differently:**

We would want to market the Telegram channel better and also create more interactive content to engage with our users on a weekly basis.

**Takeaway/learnings:**

There are a tons of things happening with other agencies which OGP could really help.
