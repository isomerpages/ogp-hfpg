#### What is Isomer Launch?
Launch your [Isomer](https://www.isomer.gov.sg/) site, quickly and freely.

#### What motivated you to build this product?
We built this to address a pain point we found when helping agencies go-live with their Isomer site.

Typically, this process is tedious. It involves a long 3-way discussion between the public officer, the Isomer team and the government agencyâ€™s IT department. All this happens to basically assign a web domain name to the Isomer site.

This usually takes 1-3 working days. The agency might also have to pay a small annual fee to register a top-level domain.

#### What tech stack did you use?

FormSG Webhook SDK, TypeScript and Express.js.

#### What were the key challenges you faced in building Isomer Launch? 

This was an interesting exercise in figuring out the challenges when working with an external co-hacker. As he did not have access to Isomer's infrastructure, it was left to someone on the Isomer team to test the prototype and adjust it for improvements.

#### What is the product vision for Isomer Launch? 
Any public officer can create a web presence on his or her own! Other possible use cases include hosting bigger web sites or services that may be temporary or otherwise have little need to register a permanent top-level domain.

#### Fun facts!
**One interesting finding:**\\
With the right top-level domain (in this case, by.gov.sg), websites parked as a subdomain can have very memorable URLs, eg, hackforpublicgood.by.gov.sg.

**One thing you'd have done differently:**\\
We might have considered getting at least one more memorable domain, perhaps at.gov.sg.
