### Problem

Members of the public are unable to identify scam websites effectively, and often fall prey to scams by sharing personal details. There is currently no fuss-free way to report malicious websites, and existing workflows/protocols are not effective at addressing this.

### Solution

SafeGuard is a mobile application that enables users to check the authenticity of a website, and report malicious ones in just a few taps. Users simply share a URL to SafeGuard, and can know instantly if a website is safe to use or not.
