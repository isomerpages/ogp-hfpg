### Problem

Public officers have no way to get their PDF documents digitally and securely signed by multiple signatories.

### Solution

Signify provides a platform to get documents digitally signed by multiple recipients sequentially or at once. In its trail phase, all signatures on Signify are powered by Sign with Singpass and are accredited by National Certification Authority. Accredited signatures made using the Sign with Singpass are regarded as secure electronic signatures under Singaporeâ€™s Electronic Transactions Act.
