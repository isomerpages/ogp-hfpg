### Problem
2 in 5 Singaporeans have experienced mental health struggles. We’ve spoken to married couples, singles, and divorcees. There’s one consensus - its hard to make friends as an adult. Loneliness isn’t all too uncommon a feeling. Studies prove that it impacts not only our mental, but also physical health.

### Solution
Folk will help people (regardless of your relationship status) expand their social circle. See hangouts nearby, or put out an invite for an activity you’d like company for. If you hold a Singpass, you’re in. Find your folks, wherever in the world you are.
