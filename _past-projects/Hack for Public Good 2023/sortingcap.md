### Problem
There is no easy way for schemes and grants to assess applicantsâ€™ eligibility. This results in applicants receiving their benefits after months, as officers need to manually check and approve every application and its supporting documents.

### Solution
sortingcap reduces application processing time from months to a minute. Agencies have the flexibility to set eligibility conditions based on verified data sources, and citizens can claim benefits simply by logging in with SGID.
