### Problem

Graphics and illustrations are often used in products, decks and marketing materials, but itâ€™s difficult to find assets that are consistent in style, representative of the Singapore population, and can clearly communicate the message.

### Solution

Build Your Own Singaporean is a modular illustration system that lets you create and download your own Singaporean characters and scenes in a few clicks.
